career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started working on web technologies using php. After a while I started using nodejs and mongodb.<br>
      During this period I really enjoyed nosql
      I got both mongodb for dbas and mongodb for programmers certifications.
      I developed various project on nodejs including a bingo-like game
      for one of my previous employers.<br>
      This is when I really started to be interested in distributed systems and efficient message passing and binary protocols.<br>
      Around 3 years ago golang really started to get my attention.<br>
      Having an event loop and async io is really nice but if you are only limited to that the design of your code goes out of control pretty quicly.<br>
      I don't mean node.js is a bad technology what I am saying is that it is really hard to coordinate and maintain nodejs systems when they start to grow.<br>
      So naturally golang was a relief for me it does not support async io out of the box but goroutines made the life pretty easy for me.<br>
      I really enjoyed golang until I hit the brick wall on one of my projects for a client. I wrote a simple video relay server for bandwidth management <br> 
      and it was fine until I got the reports of mysterious pauses in the middle of the execution which after quite some debugging and profiling led me to the Garbage collector. <br> 
      I think I could mostly solve it by reducing the number of the objects created and reusing more stuff but instead I started to implement the thing in the new language I have been experimenting for some time "Rustlang".
      <br> Of course after I discover the level of confidence, safety and speed rust provides over golang I immediately fell in love with it.
      <br> <br> Well.. As a summary I use golang and rust professionally in production right now. I am open for both project or job opportunities but not actively seeking one. <br> 

      Ps. I also mentor fellow programmers on hackhands.com, codementor.io and pluralsight.com. So In daily basis I see a lot of bugs and mistakes and help fix and improve code quality.
