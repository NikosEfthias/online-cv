career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I started working on web technologies using php. After a while I started using nodejs and mongodb.<br>
      During this period I really enjoyed nosql
      I got both mongodb for dbas and mongodb for programmers certifications.
      I developed various project on nodejs including a bingo-like game
      for one of my previous employers.<br>
      This is when I really started to be interested in distributed systems and efficient message passing and binary protocols.

      After some time especially trying to deal with binary data nodejs wasn't just enough for me (also the single threaded event loop is cool yes but limiting and makes it really hard to follow the code. Also the callback hell is a real thing.) and I was in a search and finally I met golang.<br>
      In most ways golang is a dream-came-true for me. Meanwhile I learned C and coded a lot of C, learned about memory management and all sort of buffer related things. C is particularly good in such things for learning because in go, the code we write is relatively safer and you cannot really learn without cutting yourself with sharp edges I believe.

      So as a summary currently I'm writing golang professionally and I do experiments with rust, elm and haskell. I use docker everywhere from unified build environments to testing environments. I love mongodb and I believe lots of things can be migrated mongodb from SQL databases and this often improves the speed( of course with right strategy)

      I also mentor fellow programmers on hackhands.com, codementor.io and pluralsight.com. So In daily basis I see a lot of bugs and mistakes and help fix and improve code quality.
      
      Lastly, I love Vim. I live inside of tmux and Vim generally.

experiences:
    - role: Co-Founder/CTO
      company: Vida.events
      details: |
        Developing a unique event planning app where users can organize events and invitees can vote and decide on the date, split the costs and pay through the app.
        In vida, I mixed my golang knowledge with the functional paradigm I learned and adored from haskell and the result was amazing the resulting go code was super readable super modular and really distributable because unlike objects functions are stateless and they don't care whether they are running on different cores or even different machines over different continents.
